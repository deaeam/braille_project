An Arduino project whose main goal is to help the visually impaired in digitalization and simplification of their lives.

Tasks: 
  1. Electrification of braille printing by 6 keys in 3x2 format with further translation into the usual font familiar to us
  2. Translation of electronic text into braille font and tactile transmission to the blind
 
Implementation: 
  0. Everything will work on the Arduino board, and the case will be printed on a 3D printer.Ð¹
  1. 2 pairs of 3 keys installed on the edges of the case for printing
  2. 6 servos arranged 3x2 which convert electronic text into tactile
