# braille_project
The main goal of the project is to help the visually impaired in digitalization and simplification of their lives.

Functions: 
  1. Electrification with translation into the regular alphabet from braille printing
  2. Translation from electronic format to braille with tactile feedback
 
Implementation:

  1. 2 pairs of 3 keys installed on the edges of the case for printing
  2. 6 servos arranged 3x2 which convert electronic text into tactile
  
  
List of required parts:

  1. Arduino - will serve as the brains of the project
  2. a wire connecting the device to a PC or laptop - for power supply and text input, output
  3. 3D printer - needed to print the case
  4. x9 buttons - will work as keys
  5. x6 Servos - will be responsible for tactile feedback
  6. xALot of wires for connecting components to each other
  7. x9 Resistors at 10 kOhm for stable operation of the key
 
I will attach files with connection diagrams and 3d models
